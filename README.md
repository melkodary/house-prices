### Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
People face problems in evaluating the price of the houses because of the complexity and the number of factors involved in the process, for instance, the square feet of living space, number of bathrooms, or the date of construction …etc. Therefore, people struggle to give the houses the value they deserve by using a systematic and reliable criterion.

### Content <a name="content"></a>
The repo consists of ["Ames Housing"][dataset] Dataset and a jupyter file.
